# World Economic Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This is an overview of World economic data that comprises of Corruption, Cost of living, richest Countries, Unemployment and Tourism datasets. A look through key insights within the datasets to find relationships and trends.

## Dataset

### Dataset Source
The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle: 


## Requirements
To run the project, the following packages are needed:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning:
* Handling missing values (e.g., in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns).
* Converting categorical variables to numerical format.
* Outlier detection and treatment, if necessary.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables to understand their distribution and patterns.
* Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between variables, such as Age vs. Survived or Pclass vs. Fare.
* Multivariate Analysis: Studying the interaction of multiple variables to see more complex relationships and survival trends.
### 3. Visualization:

* Graphical representations to identify patterns and trends, using plots such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.

##Key Findings

### Usage
1. Download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the notebook or update the path in the notebook code.
2. Run the notebook to perform data cleaning and EDA.
3. Modify and extend the analysis as needed based on your specific objectives.
